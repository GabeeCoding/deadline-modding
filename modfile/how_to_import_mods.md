# How to load a mod

-   Open the modfile script. This may be the one you exported in the section above or just one from the public mods section
-   Copy the FULL contents
-   Paste them to the 'server luau console' in-game (accessible after pressing the ` key, right next to Escape on your keyboard)
-   The modfile should load
-   Attachments are accessible immediately. You can set the map with `map.set_map("map_name")`
