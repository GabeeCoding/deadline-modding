# How to load a mod

-   Open the selected modfile script. There are some on this folder
-   Copy the FULL contents (you can press the "raw" button after opening the modfile github page to view just the contents or download the file and then copy it)
-   Paste them to the 'server luau console' in-game (accessible after pressing the ` key, right next to Escape on your keyboard)
-   The modfile should load
-   Attachments are accessible immediately. You can set the map with `map.set_map("map_name")`
