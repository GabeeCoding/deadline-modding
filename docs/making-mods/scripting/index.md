# Introduction

There's a new Luau scripting tool available in VIP servers in the dev branch as well as 0.23.0 game versions and onward that exposes functions used by the game directly.

## Running code

VIP servers can run code in the console. You can also use autorun, which is a script that will run
every time the VIP server starts, allowing you to have servers set themselves up without your involvement.
There is one for the client and server. The client can change sounds played by the game, create custom UI widgets, load map/attachment mods, talk to the server, etc.

## Example

```lua
---@diagnostic disable: undefined-global

if not is_private_server() and not is_studio() then
    return
end

local prefix = "/"

-- when player sends something in the chat, check if it's a command
chat.player_chatted:Connect(function(sender, channel, content)
    local command = content:split(" ")[1]
    local first_letter = command:sub(1, 1)

    -- if the first letter is the prefix, then it's a command
    if first_letter ~= prefix then
        return
    end

    -- use the command without the prefix
    command = command:sub(2, -1)

    local str = string.format("hi, %s! Ran command: %s", sender, command)
    chat.send_announcement(str, Color3.fromRGB(227, 93, 244))
end)
```
