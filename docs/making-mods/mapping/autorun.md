# Autorun

Autorun is a mechanism for making running scripts alongside maps easier.

## Modfile autorun

Mod autorun is a ModuleScript inside the mod itself called "autorun" that runs when the mod is loaded. You can see an example mod in the mod list.

## VIP server autorun

Server autorun is the autorun tabs inside the private server console. The server autorun runs when the VIP server starts letting you load a map without having to join yourself after the server restarts and the client autorun runs per-client.
